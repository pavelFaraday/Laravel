## Laravel Artisan

Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. Artisan exists at the root of your application as the artisan script and provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application.

## Tinker 

Laravel Tinker is a powerful REPL (REPL, is a computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user.) for the Laravel framework. It is like a CONSOLE for JS.

**Run Tinker**
`php artisan tinker`

**Installation**
All Laravel applications include Tinker by default. However, you may install Tinker using Composer if you have previously removed it from your application:

`composer require laravel/tinker`
